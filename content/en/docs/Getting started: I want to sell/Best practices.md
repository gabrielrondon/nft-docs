## How to choose fact checks?

**About the audience**: There are at least three types of audience to be tested: speculators, collectors, and supporters of a cause. When choosing your fact checks, think of each one. 

- Speculators: In general, they are people who have no attachment to the negotiated content. They are looking for a good (an NFT) that can be sold soon thereafter, generating financial profit. 
- Collectors: People who are attracted to a particular subject, person, format, and appreciate the acquired good. To reach this audience, try to offer historical checks, memorabilia 
- Supporters of a cause: People who want to contribute financially to the movement of the fact checkers and/or to another topic that can be addressed in the fact checks. Think about checks on the environment, national and international politics, and health.

**Choose a simple fact**: Visualize a painting on the wall containing your fact. It needs to be succinct and straight to the point. No field for factual contestation.
